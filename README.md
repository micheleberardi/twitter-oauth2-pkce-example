Ecco un esempio di `README.md` che include i passaggi per configurare l'applicazione nel Twitter Developer Portal e una descrizione di cosa fanno gli script.

# Twitter OAuth 2.0 with PKCE Example

This repository provides a complete example of how to implement OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for posting tweets using the Twitter API v2 in Python.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Twitter Developer Account
1. Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en) and log in with your Twitter account.
2. If you don't have a developer account, follow the prompts to apply for one.

### Step 2: Create a New Project and App
1. In the Twitter Developer Portal, click on "Projects & Apps" in the top menu.
2. Click on "Overview" and then "Add App" to create a new app.
3. Fill in the required information to create your app.

### Step 3: Enable OAuth 2.0
1. Go to your app settings.
2. Scroll down to the "User authentication settings" section and click "Edit".
3. Enable OAuth 2.0 and set the appropriate permissions (scopes) such as `tweet.read`, `tweet.write`, `users.read`, and `offline.access`.
4. Set a valid "Callback URI / Redirect URL" which will be used to redirect the user after authentication.
5. Save your changes.
6. Go to the "Keys and tokens" tab, and you should see your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

### Step 4: Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-oauth2-pkce-example.git
   cd twitter-oauth2-pkce-example
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install requests
   ```

### Step 5: Update the Script with Your Credentials
1. Open `twitter_auth.py` and replace `'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'` and `'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI'` with your actual Client ID and Redirect URI from the Twitter Developer Portal.
2. Ensure the redirect URI matches exactly with what you have configured in the Twitter Developer Portal.

### Step 6: Run the Script
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python twitter_auth.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to get the authorization code and input it along with the state.

## Script Explanation

### `twitter_auth.py`
This script performs the following steps:
1. **Generate Code Verifier and Challenge**: Creates a PKCE code verifier and challenge for enhanced security.
2. **Authorization URL**: Directs the user to the Twitter authorization URL to get user consent.
3. **Capture Authorization Code**: Prompts the user to manually input the authorization code and state received from Twitter.
4. **Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token**: Sends a request to Twitter to exchange the authorization code for an access token and refresh token.
5. **Post a Tweet**: Uses the access token to post a tweet on behalf of the user.
6. **Debugging**: Prints the response from the token endpoint for debugging purposes if there is an issue.

### Example Output
```plaintext
Go to the following URL and authorize the app: https://twitter.com/i/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&scope=tweet.read%20tweet.write%20users.read%20offline.access&state=RANDOM_STATE&code_challenge=RANDOM_CHALLENGE&code_challenge_method=S256
Enter the authorization code you received: AUTHORIZATION_CODE
Enter the state you received: RECEIVED_STATE
Response from token endpoint: { ... }
Successfully posted the tweet
```
